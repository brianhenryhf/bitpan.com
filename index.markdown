Hi.  I'm Brian.  

I've wrangled software for years now - web, enterprise stack, devops, you name it.  I solve complicated new problems, and I untangle byzantine legacy codebases.  I like to work with folks inside and outside of tech, and make complex problems comprehensible and, most importantly, get them solved.  

Please let me know how I can help your business thrive!: <a href="mailto:info@bitpan.com">Email</a>
