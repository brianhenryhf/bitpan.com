Hi.  I'm Brian.  I've wrangled software for years now - web, enterprise stack, devops, you name it.  I solve complicated new problems, and I untangle byzantine legacy codebases.  I like to work with folks inside and outside of tech, and make complex problems more comprehensible.  Please let me know if I can help super-charge your business!
